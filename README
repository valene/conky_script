My conky configuration scripts
More will be added as I go.

Added Reddit tracking script of Alicia.
All credits go to alicia@ion.nu.
Removed the do loop and zenity from reddit tracker.

Usage:
=====
Add threads to be followed in threads.txt 

echo "some_reddit_thread" >> ~/.scripts/threads.txt


place reddittracker.sh and threads.txt in .scripts folder of homedir.


The code only follows the latest three added threads. 
Make sure there are a minimum of three threads in threads.txt 
or
edit the conkyrc appropriately.
